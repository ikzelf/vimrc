# vimrc
This is how I try to work.
Lots' of python and bash work, al maintained in git so fugitive is a good tool to add in vim.
Next to that, there are quite some config files that are not in git. For them I want an auto backup, with a timestamp in my ~/vup/
The status line show git status, same for the gutter.

Autopairs is a nice speed-up.

Oh, and I almost forgot about the auto update of the .tags file. I like it.
